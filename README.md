## Overview
This code was used to track mesoscale eddies in an ocean ROMS model. This code was used in the paper

### Key Points
* High spatial and temporal resolution observations by ship-based and autonomous instruments in the ice-free Beaufort Sea are presented
* Modified meltwater advected about 100 km over several weeks, cooling and shoaling the mixed layer and hastening freeze up by several days
* Meltwater advection caused nearly as much mixed layer heat loss as was caused by seasonally integrated heat loss to the atmosphere

This figure shows the modeled ocean temperature field at 150 m with detected eddies outlined in black. An animation of eddy identification and tracking is [here](https://github.com/lauracrews/mesoscale-edddy-tracking-in-ROMS/blob/main/detected_eddies_animation.mp4).

##
## Code implementation
The code routine for the full analysis for the scientific paper uses MATLAB for analysis of model fields and graphics generation. The core eddy tracking routine is in Python - this tracking code is the focus of this repo. Note that the code describes "patches" as a more general term than eddies. 

#### 1.) Create mask of cells that meet or do not meet eddy criteria

`patch_grid.m` (MATLAB) 

Input: default is an .nc file containing all days of data with properties interpolated onto a constant z-grid. Script will need to be adjusted to iterate through multiple .nc files or to depth interpolate. 

User must set: Properties and thresholds to be used in patch identification

Output: Daily .csv files to be read by `patch_identification.py`

#### 2.) Identify and track eddies

`patch_identificaion.py` (Python) 

Input: Daily .csv patch grid files created by `patch_grid.m`

User must set: 
* Minimum area and maximum radius for patch identification. As currently written, patches may never exceed the maximum radius. They must initially be larger than the minimum area, but can later shrink below this value.
* Tracking parameters: Tracking works by limiting the change in patch area and center location from one frame to the next. MAX_TRAVEL is the maximum distance a patch can move as a percent of its radius. MAX_SIZECHANGE is the maximum percent change in area between frames. Increase MOVE_WEIGHT and SIZE_WEIGHT to assign more importance to minimizing movement or minimizing  size change. 

Important notes:
* Patch grid file names will be printed to console when .csv files created by `patch_grid.m` are loaded. Review printout to check that they are loaded in the correct order and that no unexpected or hidden files are also loaded. 
* If earliest patch grid day does not correspond to the first day in the .nc file (you want to start later in the .nc file), adjust Line 160 (currentDay = fileNumber + 1). This line determines the day number saved to each patch. Note that you must add one because Python is 0-indexed and MATLAB is 1-indexed (so fileNumber = 0 corresponds to .nc day = 1). 

Other requirements: Must import `patchClass.py` to define a patch object and save information about it. 

Output: Python list of patch objects. This information will be written to .csv files by `save_patches.py`

#### 3.) Save information about eddies into .csv files to be read into MATLAB

`save_patches.py` (Python) 

Input: Python list of patch objects identified in `patch_identification.py`

User must set: 
* Minimum number of days a patch persists before its information is saved. 
* The size of the model domain (i.e. the dimensions of the patch grid files created by `patch_grid.m`). 

Important note: Determining which cells are within the patch is slow. There’s probably a more efficient way to do this. If you are only interested in patch location and size (can be saved quickly), comment out the code in Lines 51-60.  

Output: 
* ‘Summary’ .csv files for each identified patch. Columns are day within the .nc file, center location, patch area, and patch velocity (distance moved from the previous frame).
* ‘Mask’ .csv files for each identified patch for each day. List of coordinates of all points within the patch. This will be made into a mask by `patch_data.m`

#### 4.) Create a MATLAB data structure with information about each eddy 

`patch_data.m` (MATLAB) Uses .nc file to calculate additional properties of the patch (i.e. interior temperature). 

Input: Patch ‘summary’ and ‘mask’ files created by `save_patches.py`

User must set: 
* Model cell grid size to convert patch area and velocity from units of cells^2 and cells/day to units of km^2  and km/day. 
* Additional patch properties to be calculated.

Optional scripts to be called:

`testOverlap.m` plots the patch_grid file used to identify patches with the identified patch contour overlaid. This ensures that patches have been identified properly. If these two contours do not align, it is likely due to a day-indexing error (need to adjust currentDay = fileNumber + 1 in patch_identification.py)

`makeSampleMask.m` creates a mask of a random subset of points within the patch. Using a smaller number of points makes the calculation of patch properties faster for any properties that require vertical calculations (i.e. the depth of maximum temperature within the water column).

Output: MATLAB data structure in which each row contains all the data for a single patch. Columns are:
1.	List of days the patch was active
2.	List  of center locations (x, y) and (lon, lat) on each day patch was active 
3.	List of patch areas on each day patch was active
4.	List of patch velocities (distance moved from previous day) on each day patch was active
5.	List of masks of cells within the patch on each day patch was active
6.	Lists of averages of patch properties (properties selected by user) on each day patch was active

#### 5.) Optionally create animation of eddy tracking 

`patch_animation.m` (MATLAB) 

Input: patches data structure created by `patch_data.m`.

User must adjust: Property to be plotted (temperature, etc), other plotting values (bathymetry contours, color axis, etc).

Other information: Calls `patchesActiveToday.m` to create a mask of all patches active on a single day
